In general, there are three main things to think about when it comes time to <a href=\"https:\/\/sleepfirstusa.com\/pages\/mattress-size-guide\" title=\"Mattress Size Guide\">choose a size<\/a> for your mattress: how many people will be sleeping on the mattress, the size of those people, and the dimensions of the bedroom.<br\/><br\/>Bigger mattress sizes like Queens, Kings and California Kings are better when there are more people and\/or a bigger space, while smaller sizes like Twin and Full \/Double are better for single sleepers and\/or smaller spaces. <a href=\"https:\/\/sleepfirstusa.com\/blogs\/your-mattress-matters\/buying-guide-what-size-mattress-is-right-for-you\">Click here to learn more<\/a>. <br\/><br\/>We carry a range of sizes from Twin all the way to Split California King.

            "answer": "<p>Not always. Though old school chiropractors used to swear that firm mattresses were the way to go for back support, that's not quite true.<br\/><br\/>Firmness and support are actually two different things: firmness has to do with the top layer of the mattress, whereas support has to do with the lower layers. It's very possible to have a soft mattress with lots of support.<br\/><br\/>When choosing between firm and soft, go with what’s most comfortable for you!<\/p>"

But go too firm and you'll likely have too much resistance on your hips and shoulders, also resulting in back pain.<br\/><br\/>The key is to find the firmness sweet spot: soft enough that the small of your back can rest comfortably on the mattress, but firm enough that your hips and shoulders are equally supported. <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sleepfirstusa.com\/blogs\/your-mattress-matters\/buying-guide-the-best-mattresses-for-back-sleepers\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Click here to learn more and get our specific recommendations.<\/strong><\/span><\/a><\/p>"

We do this because studies and customers agree that it takes about 30 days for your body to adjust to a new mattress and we want to give you that time to get used to our product before making a final decision on your sleep experience.<br\/><br\/>This trial period is 3 times longer than most other trials we have seen in the industry.<\/p>"
