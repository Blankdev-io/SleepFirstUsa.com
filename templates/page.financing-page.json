It involves a soft credit check, which gives an indication of your likelihood of approval. However, pre-qualification does not guarantee approval, as it is based on limited information.<\/li><li><strong>Application Process<\/strong>: This is the formal process of applying for the financing card. It involves a thorough review of your credit history and financial situation, which includes a hard credit inquiry that may impact your credit score. This process leads to a decision on whether you're approved for the card and determines your credit limit and terms.<\/li><\/ul>"
